# SRB2 autosplitter

This autosplitter is for **SRB2** and works with some wad mods. (well currently, the only "approved" mod is **Mystic Realm** but it does work with other mods)  
It is made to work only with version **2.1.25** and **2.2.0** of SRB2  
It also has **settings** so that you can control what it do and when.

Feel free to leave any suggestion to improve this script!

Note : Mystic Realm currently uses this autosplitter because I thought it was useless to do a 3rd one if there's only a few lines of code to add

## Functions :

- **Start** (with a choice to start on RA mode)
- **Split :** at end of level, when taking collectibles, when activating a Temple in Mystic Realm
- **Reset** ( /!\ on by default (I don't think I can change that))
- **IGT**
