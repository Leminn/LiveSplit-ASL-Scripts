# SRB2Kart autosplitter

This autosplitter is for **SRB2Kart**  
While it's a separate executable from SRB2, it works approximately like SRB2 which is really convenient.  
It is made to work with **major versions of Kart** (1.0.1 and latest for example)  
This splitter has **settings** so that you can control what it do and when.

Feel free to leave any suggestion to improve this script!

## Functions :

- **Start**
- **Split :** at end of track (and as an option on every lap)
- **Reset** when choosing the first track ( /!\ on by default (I don't think I can change that))
- **IGT**
